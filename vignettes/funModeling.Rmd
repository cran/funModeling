Package funModeling
====

## Introduction
This package covers common aspects in predictive modeling:

1. **Data Cleaning**
2. **Variable importance analysis**
3. **Assessing model performance**

Main purpose of this package is to **teach** some predictive modeling using a practical toolbox of functions and concepts, to people who is starting in data science, small data and big data. With **special focus** on results and analysis understanding.


## Part 1: Data cleaning
**Overview**: Quantity of zeros, NA, unique values; as well as the data type may  lead to a good or bad model. Here an approach to cover the very first step in data modeling. 

```{r lib, results="hide"}
## Loading needed libraries
library(funModeling)
data(heart_disease)
```

### Checking NA, zeros, data type and unique values
```{r df_status}
my_data_status=df_status(heart_disease)
```
* `q_zeros`: quantity of zeros (`p_zeros`: in percentage)
* `q_na`:  quantity of NA (`p_na`: in percentage)
* `type`: factor or numeric
* `unique`: quantity of unique values

#### Why are these metrics important?
* **Zeros**: Variables with **lots of zeros** may be not useful for modeling, and in some cases it may dramatically bias the model.
* **NA**: Several models automatically exclude rows with NA (**random forest**, for example). As a result, the final model can be biased due to several missing rows because of only one variable. For example, if the data contains only one out of 100 variables with 90% of NAs, the model will be training with only 10% of original rows.
* **Type**: Some variables are encoded as numbers, but they are codes or categories, and the models **don't handle them** in the same way.
* **Unique**: Factor/categorical variables with a high number of different values (~30), tend to do overfitting if categories have low representative, (**decision tree**, for example).

#### Filtering unwanted cases
Function `df_status` takes a data frame and returns a the status table to quickly remove unwanted cases.


**Removing variables with high number of NA/zeros**
```{r df_status3}
# Removing variables with 60% of zero values
vars_to_remove=subset(my_data_status, my_data_status$p_zeros > 60)
vars_to_remove["variable"]

## Keeping all except vars_to_remove 
heart_disease_2=heart_disease[, !(names(heart_disease) %in% vars_to_remove[,"variable"])]

```

**Ordering data by percentage of zeros**
```{r df_status4}
my_data_status[order(-my_data_status$p_zeros),]
```

## Part 2: Variable importance with cross_plot
* **Overview**:
    + **Analysis purpose**: To identify if the input variable is a good/bad predictor through visual analysis. 
    + **General purpose**: To explain the decision of including -or not- a variable to a model to a *non-analyst* person. 

**Constraint:** Target variable must have only 2 values. If it has `NA` values, they will be removed.

*Note: Please note there are many ways for selecting best variables to build a model, here is presented one more based on visual analysis.*

### Example 1: Is gender correlated with heart disease?
```{r variable_importance1, results="hide", fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
cross_gender=cross_plot(heart_disease, str_input="gender", str_target="has_heart_disease")
```

Last two plots have the same data source, showing the distribution of `has_heart_disease` in terms of `gender`. The one on the left shows in percentage value, while the one on the right shows in absolute value.

#### How to extract conclusions from the plots? (Short version)
`Gender` variable seems to be a **good predictor**, since the likelihood of having heart disease is different given the female/male groups.  **it gives an order to the data**.

#### How to extract conclusions from the plots? (Long version)
##### From 1st plot (%):

1. The **likelihood** of having heart disease for males is 55.3%, while for females is: 25.8%.
2. The heart disease rate for males **doubles** the rate for females (55.3 vs 25.8, respectively). 

##### From 2nd plot (count):

1. There are a total of **97 females**:
    + 25 of them have heart disease (25/97=25.8%, which is the ratio of 1st plot).
    + the remaining 72 have not heart disease (74.2%)

2. There are a total of **206 males**:
    + 114 of them have heart disease (55.3%)
    + the remaining 92 have not heart disease (44.7%)

3. Total cases: Summing the values of four bars: 25+72+114+92=**303**.

*Note: What would it happened if instead of having the rates of 25.8% vs. 55.3% (female vs male), they had been more similar like 30.2% vs. 30.6%). In this case variable `gender` it would have been much less relevant, since it doesn't separate the `has_heart_disease` event.*

### Example 2: Crossing with numerical variables
Numerical variables should be **binned** in order to plot them with an histogram, otherwise the plot is not showing information, as it can be seen here:


#### Equal frequency binning
There is a function included in the package (inherited from Hmisc package) : `equal_freq`, which returns the bins/buckets based on the **equal frequency criteria**. Which is *-or tries to-* have the same quantity of rows per bin.

For numerical variables, `cross_plot` has by default the `auto_binning=T`, which automtically calls the `equal_freq` function with `n_bins=10` (or the closest number).

```{r variable_importance2, results="hide", fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
cross_plot(heart_disease, str_input="max_heart_rate", str_target="has_heart_disease")
```

### Example 3: Manual binning
If you don't want the automatic binning, then set the `auto_binning=F` in `cross_plot` function.

For example, creating `oldpeak_2` based on equal frequency, with 3 buckets.

```{r variable_importance3}
heart_disease$oldpeak_2=equal_freq(var=heart_disease$oldpeak, n_bins = 3)
summary(heart_disease$oldpeak_2)
```

Plotting the binned variable (`auto_binning = F`):
```{r variable_importance4, results="hide", fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
cross_oldpeak_2=cross_plot(heart_disease, str_input="oldpeak_2", str_target="has_heart_disease", auto_binning = F)
```

#### **Conclusion**
This new plot based on `oldpeak_2` shows clearly how: the likelihood of **having heart disease increases** as **oldpeak_2 increases** as well. *Again, it gives an order to the data.*

### Example 3: Noise reducing
Converting variable `max_heart_rate` into a one of 10 bins:

```{r variable_importance5, results="hide", fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
heart_disease$max_heart_rate_2=equal_freq(var=heart_disease$max_heart_rate, n_bins = 10)
cross_plot(heart_disease, str_input="max_heart_rate_2", str_target="has_heart_disease")
```

At a first glance, `max_heart_rate_2` shows a negative and linear relationship, however there are some buckets which add noise to the relationship. For example, the bucket `(141, 146]` has a higher heart disease rate than the previous bucket, and it was expected to have a lower. *This could be noise in data.* 

**Key note**: One way to reduce the **noise** (at the cost of **losing** some information), is to split with less bins:

```{r variable_importance6, results="hide", fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
heart_disease$max_heart_rate_3=equal_freq(var=heart_disease$max_heart_rate, n_bins = 5)
cross_plot(heart_disease, str_input="max_heart_rate_3", str_target="has_heart_disease")
```

**Conclusion**: As it can be seen, now the relationship is much clean and clear. Bucket *'N'* has a higher rate than *'N+1'*, which implies a negative correlation.


**How about saving the cross_plot result into a folder?**
Just set the parameter `path_out` with the folder you want -It creates a new one if it doesn't exists-.
```{r massive_cross_plot1, eval=FALSE}
cross_plot(heart_disease, str_input="max_heart_rate_3", str_target="has_heart_disease", path_out="my_plots")
```
It creates the folder `my_plots` into the working directory. 

### Example 4: `cross_plot` on multiple variables
Imagine you want to run cross_plot for several variables at the same time. To achieve this goal you define a list of strings containing all the variables to use as input in the `cross_plot`, and then, call the function `massive_cross_plot`.

If you want to analyze these 3 variables: 
```{r massive_cross_plot2, eval=FALSE}
vars_to_analyze=c("age", "oldpeak", "max_heart_rate")
```

```{r massive_cross_plot3, eval=FALSE}
massive_cross_plot(data=heart_disease, str_target="has_heart_disease", str_vars=vars_to_analyze)
```


**Automatically saving all the results into a folder**
Same as `cross_plot`, this function has the `path_out` parameter.

```{r massive_cross_plot4, eval=FALSE}
massive_cross_plot(data=heart_disease, str_target="has_heart_disease", str_vars=vars_to_analyze, path_out="my_plots")
```

### Final notes:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation
* `cross_plot` is good to visualize **linear** relationships, giving it a hint on **non-linear** relationships.
* Cleaning the variables help the model to better modelize the data.


## Part 3: Assessing model performance

**Overview**: Once the predictive model is developed with `training` data, it should be compared with `test` data (which wasn't seen by the model before). Here is presented a wrapper for the **ROC Curve** and **AUC** (area under ROC) and  the **KS** (Kolmogorov-Smirnov).


### Creating the model
```{r model_perfomance1}
## Training and test data. Percentage of training cases default value=80%.
index_sample=get_sample(data=heart_disease, percentage_tr_rows=0.8)

## Generating the samples
data_tr=heart_disease[index_sample,] 
data_ts=heart_disease[-index_sample,]


## Creating the model only with training data
fit_glm=glm(has_heart_disease ~ age + oldpeak, data=data_tr, family = binomial)

```

### ROC, AUC and KS performance metrics
```{r model_perfomance2,  fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
## Performance metrics for Training Data
model_performance(fit=fit_glm, data = data_tr, target_var = "has_heart_disease")

## Performance metrics for Test Data
model_performance(fit=fit_glm, data = data_ts, target_var = "has_heart_disease")
```

**Key notes**

* The **higher** the KS and AUC, the **better** the performance is.
    + KS range: from 0 to 1.
    + AUC range: from 0.5 to 1.
* Performance metrics should be **similar** between training and test set.

**Final comments**

* KS and AUC focus on similar aspects: How well the model distinguishes the class to predict.
